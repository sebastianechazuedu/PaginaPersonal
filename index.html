                A web designer creates the look, layout, and features of a website. The job involves understanding both
                graphic design and computer programming. Once a website is created, a designer helps with maintenance
                and additions to the website. They work with development teams or managers for keeping the site
                up-to-date and prioritizing needs, among other tasks.

                <h2>VISUAL DESIGN</h2>
                <p>might seems obvious that you need design knowledge to be a web designer, but visual design focuses
                    on digital products, so it might be different than what you expect. In this case, design principles
                    are what determine the look and feel of a site. They can range from proportions to typography, to
                    grid systems, to color theory. In other words: visual design is your chance to dig into creating
                    mood boards and type hierarchy and experimenting with web fonts and color palettes.</p>

                <h2>DESIGN SOFTWARE</h2>
                <p>Like any craftsperson, to do your work you need the right tools. Knowing your way around the industry
                    standards will be helpful in every case and critical in many. While designing a website can be done
                    right in a web browser, tools like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Sketch are ones that almost all
                    designers use for important parts of their job like creating mockups, designing assets (think logos
                    and images), and of course modifying and enhancing photos. You should learn how to use them
                    (although, if you’re just getting started, consider trying out a few free photoshop alternatives
                    instead)</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Several sterling references: Be sure to call the references and ask how well the designer worked
                        with the customer.</li>
                    <li>A trail of good Web sites: Examine the work of the designer by visiting several Web sites
                        developed by that person.</li>
                    <li>A clear list of what is and isn’t provided in the Web design project: Find out things such as
                        whether the designer puts your site on the Internet for you or notifies search engines that your
                        site is available.</li>
                    <li>The ability to optimize your site for search engines: Find a Web designer who understands how to
                        perfect your site so that customers can find you.</li>
